# You are given an integer array cards of length 4. You have four cards, each containing a number in the range [1, 9]. You should arrange the numbers on these cards in a mathematical expression using the operators ['+', '-', '*', '/'] and the parentheses '(' and ')' to get the value 24.
#
# You are restricted with the following rules:
#
#
# 	The division operator '/' represents real division, not integer division.
#
#
# 		For example, 4 / (1 - 2 / 3) = 4 / (1 / 3) = 12.
#
#
# 	Every operation done is between two numbers. In particular, we cannot use '-' as a unary operator.
#
# 		For example, if cards = [1, 1, 1, 1], the expression "-1 - 1 - 1 - 1" is not allowed.
#
#
# 	You cannot concatenate numbers together
#
# 		For example, if cards = [1, 2, 1, 2], the expression "12 + 12" is not valid.
#
#
#
#
# Return true if you can get such expression that evaluates to 24, and false otherwise.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: cards = [4,1,8,7]
# Output: true
# Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: cards = [1,2,1,2]
# Output: false
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	cards.length == 4
# 	1 <= cards[i] <= 9
#
