# Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "bcabc"
# Output: "abc"
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
# Output: "acdb"
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	1 <= s.length <= 104
# 	s consists of lowercase English letters.
#
