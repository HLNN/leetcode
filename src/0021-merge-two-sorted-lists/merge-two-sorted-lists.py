# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
# Output: []
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
# 	Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
