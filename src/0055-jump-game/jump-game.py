# Given an array of non-negative integers nums, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
#
# Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
#
# Determine if you are able to reach the last index.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
# Output: true
# Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
# Output: false
# Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
# 	0 <= nums[i] <= 105
#
#


class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        lastPos = len(nums) - 1
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            if i + nums[i] >= lastPos:
                lastPos = i
        return lastPos == 0
