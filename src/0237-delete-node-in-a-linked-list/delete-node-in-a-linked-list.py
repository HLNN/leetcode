# Write a function to delete a node in a singly-linked list. You will not be given access to the head of the list, instead you will be given access to the node to be deleted directly.
#
# It is guaranteed that the node to be deleted is not a tail node in the list.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
# Output: [4,1,9]
# Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 1
# Output: [4,5,9]
# Explanation: You are given the third node with value 1, the linked list should become 4 -> 5 -> 9 after calling your function.
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range [2, 1000].
# 	-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
# 	The value of each node in the list is unique.
# 	The node to be deleted is in the list and is not a tail node
#
