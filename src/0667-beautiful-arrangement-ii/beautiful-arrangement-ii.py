# Given two integers n and k, construct a list answer that contains n different positive integers ranging from 1 to n and obeys the following requirement:
#
#
# 	Suppose this list is answer = [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly k distinct integers.
#
#
# Return the list answer. If there multiple valid answers, return any of them.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: n = 3, k = 1
# Output: [1,2,3]
# Explanation: The [1,2,3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1,1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: n = 3, k = 2
# Output: [1,3,2]
# Explanation: The [1,3,2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2,1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	1 <= k < n <= 104
#
#


class Solution:
    def constructArray(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[int]:
        res = list(range(1, n - k))
        for i in range(k + 1):
            if i % 2 == 0:
                res.append(n - k + i // 2)
            else:
                res.append(n - i // 2)
        
        return res
