# Given a singly linked list L: L0→L1→…→Ln-1→Ln,
# reorder it to: L0→Ln→L1→Ln-1→L2→Ln-2→…

# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself may be changed.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Given 1->2->3->4, reorder it to 1->4->2->3.
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Given 1->2->3->4->5, reorder it to 1->5->2->4->3.
