# You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:
#
#
# L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
#
#
# Reorder the list to be on the following form:
#
#
# L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
#
#
# You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
# Output: [1,4,2,3]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	The number of nodes in the list is in the range [1, 5 * 104].
# 	1 <= Node.val <= 1000
