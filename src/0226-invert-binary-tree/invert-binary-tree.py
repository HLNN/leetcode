# Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.
#
#  
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3,6,9]
# Output: [4,7,2,9,6,3,1]
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = [2,1,3]
# Output: [2,3,1]
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
#
#
#  
# Constraints:
#
#
# 	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
# 	-100 <= Node.val <= 100
#
#
#  
# Trivia:
# This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
#
# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you can’t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.
